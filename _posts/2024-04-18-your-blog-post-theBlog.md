## Linear Algebra day 1


Product: considered mutiply. Square matrix (quadratic matrix): n*n matrix.

Vector Product: take the matrix as a collection of vectors, multiply it with a certain vector that has the same dimention as the formers. Like what vectors mul doing.
then sum every row as a 1 element row.
Example: n*3 Matrix * a 3D vector in a column that look like 1*3 Matrix. Rotate the vector for better visual.

Product/mul: Rotate the left matrix for cube calculation, make it a cube.

Add/sub:-

Transposed Matrix: Denoted in the top right side as a T. A^T = do swap for the main diagonal. (aij<->aji).symmetric

Element Matrix: Denoted as E. Main diagonal all put i others 0.

Equality: Looked absolute the same.
There is another quasi-equality thing idk what it called.

Inversed Matrix:A*A^-1=(belongs?)E, where as A^-1 denotes the inversed matrix of A.

Technics: Finding the inversed matrix of A. 增广矩阵分块构造->上三角化。or 待定系数分类解三个方程组。
