## BandMatrix

Entry:element~stuff collected in a matrix.



<p>bandwidth: calculated from the main DA, means how far can you get to the first nonzero entry bu minus 1. Z.B. for any E the bandwidth is zero.</p><br><br>
<p>Upper/lower bandwidth: upper the main diagonal called upper bandwidth(visually), sync to lower. So for an E/identity matrix, upper=lower.</p>
